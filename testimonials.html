            <p class="lead">"My wife, Casey,  and I met through Zodie almost five years ago.  From our profiles, we already knew that we had important things in common, and none of the typical deal breakers. After dating for a few years, we decided to get married,  outdoors, of course, in the open night sky on Folly Beach.  We celebrate our first anniversary next month. I don't think we would have met without Zodie!

                Thank you!"

            <p class="lead">"You cannot imagine how reluctant I was about going on dating sites until I found yours. In a moment of inspiration I started to fill in the profile with all honesty and no expectations and it paid off. I had contact within a few members but nothing happened. Or maybe there was someone and I just did not know it yet. Tony contacted me and we started writing. When we met it was amazing how the conversation flowed and how we laughed a lot. Every date was magic and when we went for a picnic surrounded by nature I knew he was the love of my life" </p>
